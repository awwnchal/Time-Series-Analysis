# Time-Series-Analysis

This repository contains the R code and output for the time series analysis exercises we completed from the book "Forecasting: Principles and Practice" by Rob Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos.

# Chapter 2 - Time series graphics

# Problem 4
In this problem, we were asked to create a time series plot for the monthly number of international airline passengers from 1949 to 1960. Our solution can be found in the file ch2_prob4.html, which includes the R code and output.

# Chapter 3 - Time series decomposition
Problem 7
For this problem, we were tasked with decomposing the following quarterly time series data into trend, seasonal, and remainder components:
